Kruidnoten are small, round, cookie-like confectioneries with a crispy texture, traditionally associated with the early December Sinterklaas festivities in the Netherlands.

The term kruidnoten is often confused with pepernoten. Kruidnoten, which translates to "gingerbread buttons" in English, are harder, have a different colour and shape, and are made with the same ingredients as speculaas.

## Benodigdheden

-   4 teaspoons 
-   250 gram  self-raising flour 
-   125 gram  darkbrown sugar 
-   100 gram  cold hard butter 
-   6 tablespoons  milk 
-   1 pinch  salt 

## Bereiding

1.  Take a baking tray out of the oven and preheat that oven at 175 degrees Celsius (345 degrees Fahrenheit) 
2.  Mix all the dry ingredients (self-raising flower, sugar, speculaaskruiden and salt) 
3.  Add the butter and milk and knead everything into one firm ball by hand. 
4.  Create small balls out of this dough, about the size of a marble. Push them down on the tray a bit so they'll have a flat bottom. (This mixture should give you about 70 balls.) 
5.  when your tray is full, put it in the pre-heated oven for 25 minutes. 
6.  After they've cooled down a bit, start eating! Enjoy :) 

## Notities

These kruidnoten are often called Pepernoten in the Netherlands, although this is a very different treat. For the Dutchies that are interested in this matter: "Wat is het verschil tussen pepernoten en kruidnoten?" [onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/pe...](https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/pepernoten-kruidnoten)
