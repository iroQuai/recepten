Speculaas, abroad also known as windmill cookies, are a type of spiced shortcrust biscuit. Traditionally they were eaten on or just before St Nicholas’ day. But in modern times they’re pretty much associated with the entire month of December or basically just the entire cold season. They’re just that tasty!

Speculaas spice mix isn’t the same as British mixed spice and American pumpkin pie spice but they are similar, as they share many of the same ingredients. What mainly sets the speculaas spice mix apart is the addition of cardamom.

## Benodigdheden

-   8 teaspoons  cinnamon 
-   2 teaspoons  ground cloves 
-   2 teaspoons  grated nutmeg 
-   1 teaspoon  ground coriander seeds 
-   1 teaspoon  ground aniseed 
-   1 teaspoon  ground ginger 
-   1 teaspoon  white pepper 
-   ¾ teaspoon  ground cardamom 

## Bereiding

1.  Put all the ingredients together and stir well. Store your spice blend in an airtight container for up to six months. 
2.  There may be some spices you can only find whole. To turn them into a powder, dry roast them in a hot pan until they start to release their aroma. Then transfer them to a mortar and pestle and grind the spices to a fine powder.
